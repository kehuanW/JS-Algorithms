Evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of its input size.

Time complexity: Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.

Space complexity: Amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.



Big O - worst

Omega - best

Theta - average



Time Complexity: Count the number of times a statement execute based on the input size.

Recursion:

- Need a base case

- not always translate to a faster solution
- Not straight forward to understand
